iOS 8 UI Kit + for Sketch
===========

I've extended and updated the excelente Teehan+Lax built-in UI kit to iOS 8 and I've added some new elements.

To download simply click the *Download ZIP* button on the right sidebar


## About the kit

* Every single element was made using Sketch.

* You can edit everything to fit your needs.
* I've created symbols out of the elements, so it's easier to add them to your project. No need to copy and paste.
* I will be updating the file to match the beta releases.
* Feel free to send me some element requests, if I find the time I'll add them to the kit.
